`pip install [-U] pyrimidine`

## Requirements

`Pyrimidine` requires few packages. It only needs `numpy/scipy` for computing, and `pandas/matplotlib` for visualization. 

The author also recommends `digit_converter` for chromosome encoding of solutions.

`ezstat` is also required for statistics which is also created by the author.

## First test

```python
import pyrimidine
# or from pyrimidine import *
```
